# root with DIST_TAG and EXPECTED_VERSION set. Exits nonzero (refuses)
# unless every rule holds:
#
#   - the manifest names exactly this package;
#   - the version is stable SemVer (no prerelease, no build metadata) and
#     equals the operator-confirmed EXPECTED_VERSION;
#   - the version is not 0.1.0 -- the pre-repository bootstrap version is
#     immutable, never republished, and never gains a provenance attestation;
#   - the dist-tag is exactly `candidate`;
#   - no npm auth token is present in the environment or in any applicable
#     npm configuration, and every token inspection must itself succeed --
#     a failing inspection refuses rather than concealing a token;
#   - the registry definitively reports the version absent: the JSON error
#     output must parse cleanly with error code exactly E404 and carry no
#     other failure marker. Mixed or unparseable output (DNS, timeout,
#     auth, 5xx, cached fragments) refuses.
#
# This script performs no publish and no mutation of any kind.
